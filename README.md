# SQL Practice Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Practice Repository! This is a space where I document and share SQL scripts and exercises that cover both beginner and intermediate-level concepts.
## Topics Covered

### Beginner Level
- **Creating Tables:** Learn how to define table structures using `CREATE TABLE`, specify data types, and set constraints like `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`.
  
- **SELECT Statements:** Fetch data from tables using `SELECT`, choose specific columns, and apply expressions.
  
- **WHERE Clause:** Filter results using conditions with operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
  
- **LIKE Operator:** Use wildcard matching (`%`, `_`) to find patterns.
  
- **GROUP BY Clause:** Group rows based on column values and apply aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
  
- **ORDER BY Clause:** Sort query results using `ASC` or `DESC`.
  
- **HAVING Clause:** Apply conditions on grouped results.
  
- **LIMIT Clause:** Control how many rows are returned.
  
- **Aliasing:** Use `AS` to rename columns or tables.

### Intermediate Level

- **CASE Statements:** Introduce conditional logic inside queries.

  
- **Joins:** Combine data from multiple tables:
  
  - `INNER JOIN`: Retrieves matching records.
  - `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all records from the left table.
  - `RIGHT JOIN`: Returns all records from the right table.
  - `FULL JOIN`: Retrieves all records from both tables.
    
- **Subqueries:** Use queries within queries.
  
- **Window Functions:** Perform calculations across rows:
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique number to each row.
  - `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns rank values.
  - `LAG()` and `LEAD()`: Access previous or next row values.
    
- **String Functions:** Work with text data using `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`, `TRIM()`, `UPPER()`, and `LOWER()`.
  
- **Unions:** Combine results from multiple queries:
  - `UNION`: Merges distinct records.
  - `UNION ALL`: Merges all records, including duplicates.
