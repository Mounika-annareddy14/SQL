# SQL Practice Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Practice Repository! This is where I documented and shared SQL scripts and exercises covering beginner ,intermediate and Advanced -level concepts. I practiced and improved my SQL skills through hands-on examples, learning different ways to manipulate and query data.

## Topics Covered

### Beginner Level
- **Created Tables:** Defined table structures using `CREATE TABLE`, specified data types, and set constraints like `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`.
  
- **Used SELECT Statements:** Retrieved data from tables using `SELECT`, chose specific columns, and applied expressions.
  
- **Applied WHERE Clause:** Filtered results using conditions with operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
  
- **Used LIKE Operator:** Applied wildcard matching (`%`, `_`) to find patterns in data.

  
- **Grouped Data with GROUP BY:** Grouped rows based on column values and applied aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
  
- **Sorted Data with ORDER BY:** Ordered query results using `ASC` or `DESC`.

  
- **Filtered Groups with HAVING Clause:** Applied conditions on grouped results.

  
- **Limited Results with LIMIT Clause:** Controlled the number of rows returned in a query.
  
- **Used Aliasing:** Renamed columns or tables using `AS` for better readability.

### Intermediate Level

- **Implemented CASE Statements:** Introduced conditional logic inside queries.
  
- **Performed Joins:** Combined data from multiple tables:
  
  - `INNER JOIN`: Retrieved matching records.
  - `LEFT JOIN`: Returned all records from the left table.
  - `RIGHT JOIN`: Returned all records from the right table.
  - `FULL JOIN`: Retrieved all records from both tables.
    
- **Used Subqueries:** Executed queries within queries to fetch specific results.
  
- **Worked with Window Functions:** Performed calculations across rows:
  
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigned a unique number to each row.
  - `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigned rank values to rows.
  - `LAG()` and `LEAD()`: Accessed previous or next row values in a dataset.
    
- **Used String Functions:** Manipulated text data using `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`, `TRIM()`, `UPPER()`, and `LOWER()`.
  
- **Combined Queries with Unions:** Merged results from multiple queries:
  - `UNION`: Combined distinct records.
  - `UNION ALL`: Combined all records, including duplicates.
### Advanced Level

- **Used Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Created temporary result sets with `WITH` to improve query readability and reusability.
  
- **Implemented Stored Procedures:** Wrote reusable SQL procedures using `CREATE PROCEDURE` to execute logic with input parameters.

- **Worked with Temporary Tables:** Created temporary datasets using `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`, which existed only for the session.

- **Created Triggers:** Automated actions using `CREATE TRIGGER` to execute SQL statements before or after data changes (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
  
- **Scheduled Events:** Used `CREATE EVENT` to automate tasks like backups, periodic updates, and data cleanup at scheduled intervals.
